# MailTasker-GitHub-Repository

# 📧 MailTasker

**MailTasker** is a simple, lightweight task management web app built with **Python Flask**. It allows users to manage tasks derived from emails — view them, mark as done, delete them, and filter based on task status.  

This project was created as a submission for the [Postmark Challenge: Inbox Innovators](https://dev.to/challenges/postmark).
